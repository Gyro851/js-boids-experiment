        Ever wonder how birds know where to fly when in a giant flock? How do they decide where to go, and how does the flock make it to their destination? Is there an "alpha bird" that tells them where to fly?
        <br/>

        The following experiment uses D3 to generate simulated birds. It turns out birds follow 3 simple instructions. I created an infinite loop to simulate time, and each "tick" each bird makes a decision and moves following these three rules:
        <ol>
            <li>Each bird aims for the center of the flock</li>
            <li>Each bird avoids colliding with other birds</li>
            <li>Try to match your velocity to the velocity of the other birds</li>
        </ol>
        If you follow these three rules, you too can fly in a flock like birds.
